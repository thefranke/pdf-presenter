= Presenting a PDF =

Open up PDF Presenter and click on *Open PDF*. Select your presentation slides, for instance a PDF file done with Beamer, and in the two separated views in the main window you should see the first and second slide.

You can navigate through your slides with the buttons *Previous slide* and *Next slide*. Click on *Toggle presentation* to open up another window showing just the current slide (left hand view). Drag this window to another screen and double click into its center, or press *Alt+F* or *Ctrl+Enter* to maximize it to fullscreen. Go back with your mouse to the other screen and navigate through your slides. As long as *Toggle presentation* remains active, the second screen will show the current slide.
